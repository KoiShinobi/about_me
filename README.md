## Biography
<p>
My name is Victor Kang, and I'm a student of St.Clair College.
What most people don't know about me is that I'm quite the coding <i>"expertise"</i> and I plan to achieve greatness.
My favorite pass time is looking for <b>DANK</b> memes to get over my internal struggle of the <b>darkness</b> within me.
I love to slay heartless and save the many disney worlds from darkness with my pals Donald, and Goofy.
I'm also a huge Kingdom Hearts nerd.
